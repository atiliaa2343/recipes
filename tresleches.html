       <h2>Ingredients for the cake</h2>
       <ul> 
           <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder</li>
           <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
           <li>5 eggs</li>
           <li>1 cup of sugar,divided</li>
           <li>1 tsp. vanilla</li>
           <li>1/3 cup of milk</li>
           <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
           <li>1 can sweetened,condensed milk</li>
           <li>1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
       </ul> 

       <h2>For the icing</h2>
       <ul> 
           <li>1 pt. heavy cream, for whipping</li>
           <li>3 tbsp. sugar</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Directions</h2>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350. Spray a 9 x 13 inch liberally until coated.</li>
       <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate eggs.</li>
       <li>Beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Stir in milk and vanilla. 
           Pour egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir very gently until combined.
       </li> 
       <li>Beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer on, pour in remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat
           until egg whites are stiff but not dry.</li>
           <li>Fold egg white mixture into the batter very gently until just combined. Pour into prepared pan and spread to even out the surface.</li>
           <li>Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Turn cake out onto a rimmed platter and allow to cool.</li>
           <li>Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream in a small pitcher. When cake is cool, pierce the surface with a fork several times.
               Slowly drizzle all but about 1 cup of the milk mixture-try to get as much around the edges of the cake as you can.
           </li> 
           <li>Allow the cake to absorb the milk mixture for 30 minutes. To ice the cake, whip 1 pint heavy cream with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick and spreadable.</li>
           <li>Spread over the surface of the cake. Decorate cake with whole or chopped maraschino cherries. Cut into squares and serve.</li>
